We are building a high-frequency market-making bot. All development must align with the vision in @roadmap.md.

## Core Directives
1. **Context Awareness:** Always refer to @roadmap.md to see which Phase we are currently in.
2. **Modular Architecture:** Follow the directory structure defined in Step 1 of the roadmap (app/core, app/data, etc.).
3. **Tech Stack Enforcement:**
   - Use **Asynchronous Python** (`asyncio`) and `ccxt` for data streaming.
   - Use **TimescaleDB** for historical SQL data and **Redis** for real-time caching.
   - Use **Pydantic-settings** for all configuration (refer to @app/core).
4. **Step-by-Step Execution:** Do not skip ahead to Phase 4 while we are working on Phase 1. Focus on building robust "Data Reactor" infrastructure first.

## Coding Style
- Prefer `pipfreeze > requirements.txt` for dependency management.
- Always include a `.gitignore` to prevent committing `venv/` or `.env`.
